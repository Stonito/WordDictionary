Long ago in an ancient land far beyond the sea 
People used to live in peace and their souls were free
They believed that their world was eternal and safe
But their sacred kingdom soon would become their grave

The skies are blurry, the earth in dark decay
Impending fury, will take your life away

Buried for a thousand years deep in cave of stone
Long forgotten creature sleeps since the new age's dawn
But a darkness now descends in its lonely lair
And the beast is now awake, roaming in despair

Infinite madness, power beyond control
Embrace the darkness, that's what awaits us all

-My darkness will destroy you-
-Your soul shall be my slave-
-And as my rage consumes you-
-Your world will die in flames-

No more peace in the land and happiness for the people
No more days of delight, serenity, joy and love
Welcome to a new world where you must fight for survival
Evil has shown, the peace is gone, all life in fire


Dark days are coming
Dark days of death
The beast is roaming and destruction comes ahead
Survive or suffer
Damnation cause
Your world is cursed as the storm approaches

No one now can hear your call
Find a way to save your soul

The ground is shaking, the sky turns black
Evil has awakened, ready to attack
Destructive fire, hell now comes to life
Face death's desire, 'cuz your nightmare has arrived
Firestorm

The dragon's flying
In fiery skies
Young men are dying, everything collides
Blood, death and fear
Agony maze
The end is near, now the whole world is ablaze

No one now can hear your call
Find a way to save your soul

The ground is shaking, the sky turns black
Evil has awakened, ready to attack
Destructive fire, hell now comes to life
Face death's desire, 'cuz your nightmare has arrived
Firestorm

At last it's over
The beast is gone
Shadow no longer, so brightly shines the sun
But there in ashes
In blood and grime
A hero's watching, waiting for his time

No one now can hear your call
Find a way to save your soul

The ground is shaking, the sky turns black
Evil has awakened, ready to attack
Destructive fire, hell now comes to life
Face death's desire, 'cuz your nightmare has arrived
Firestorm


Fade away like a star in morning light
God is blind
Time will heal all the wounds and we will rise
We will fight 
We will fight

RISE, path to hell today we choose
There is nothing left to lose
FIGHT, we will never see the sun
Thousand souls now strike as one

Dragon cleave
No reprieve
Never flee
We fight to live
Our hearts are free
We fight to live

BURN, in the fires of endless pain
Everything has gone insane
DIE, we may fall in grasp of death
But we'll fight until last breath

The fearsome beast we'll pacify
We will cleanse the world and reach the sky
Our hearts are free
We fight to live
Mortals believe
Fight to live

But we will never surrender
A hero among us will rise
The darkness will break like an ember
And evil will face its demise

Face demise
Agonize
Hope of light
He will fight

In the cold, windy night a young man climbs
The chosen one
And he knows that the truth in mountain's heart
He will find


Standing on the mountain, talking with the seer
What is going to be my fate, what I'm going to hear
I looked up to the skies when a light came to my eyes
It was my Lord giving me advice

He told me I am the one who must save us from the curse
A bad thing would be done and the world might get so worse
Then I got my sword, prepared to get on the board
I must walk on this way, to prove I'm the hero as they say

(FIRE) Fire in my eyes
(WAR) Hear my battle cry
(DEATH) I will pay this price
'Cuz I am the Dragonslayer
(FIRE) Fire in my eyes
(WAR) Hear my battle cry
(DEATH) I will pay this price

Wings that cover the sun, harder scales than steel
Claws and teeth that shatter bones, but fear I do not feel
The beast is lying in the cave, waiting to get my life
But I'll never be a slave, in this bloody battle now I dive

(FIRE) Fire in my eyes
(WAR) Hear my battle cry
(DEATH) I will pay this price
'Cuz I am the Dragonslayer
(FIRE) Fire in my eyes
(WAR) Hear my battle cry
(DEATH) I will pay this price
I am the Dragonslayer

Standing on the mountain, cleaning my bloody sword
I am victorious and the dragon's head is my reward
I looked up to the skies, there was no more danger there
But I am sure that's not the end because I am the Dragonslayer

           (FIRE) Fire in my eyes           
                (WAR) Hear my battle cry            
      (DEATH) I will pay this price        
           'Cuz I am the Dragonslayer   
(FIRE) Fire in my eyes           
                (WAR) Hear my battle cry            
      (DEATH) I will pay this price        
           'Cuz I am the Dragonslayer                  


A hero marches, he has survived
The Dragonslayer, he is alive
"Long live the king!", the people cheer
A young bard sings: "He is here!"

Might, Honour, I am the ruler now
Glory, Strength, But this is not the end

I'm not a king (I'm not a king)
I am a God (I am a God)
Challenge me and you will die
Come and see 
I am the King of the Sky

The land is free, the sky is bright
A peaceful sea, infinite light
No more upheaval, but in this peace
A newborn evil is now released

Might, Honour, I am the ruler now
Glory, Strength, But this is not the end

I'm not a king (I'm not a king)
I am a God (I am a God)
Challenge me and you will die
Come and see 
I am the King of the Sky

Pain, Blood, I am the ruler now
Hate, Death, And this is not the end

I'm not a king (I'm not a king)
I am a God (I am a God)
Challenge me and you will die
Come and see 
I am the King of the Sky


In the darkness of the night
We are charging, we will fight
Hear the sound of the war drum
Our freedom is to come

Our kingdom and land we'll defend
On the wings of faith we fly
And the evil will come to an end
YOU ALL WILL DIE

Your rebellion will fail
Devastation will prevail
You will suffer in death's gale
I'm the master of the hell

There before the golden gate
Thousands bloody eyes await
"Come and show us what you can"
God will face the mortal men

Our souls will be banished no more
There is light up in the sky
And the peace in our land we'll restore
YOU ALL WILL DIE

Your rebellion will fail
Devastation will prevail
You will suffer in death's gale
I'm the master of the hell

I'm immortal, you are prey
Kneel before me and obey

Rise from the ashes I will
My mortal wounds I will heal
Stronger than now I'll return
In my realm you will burn
You'll burn
You'll burn
BURN


Freedom, free at last, peace has finally returned in our land

Pieces from the shattered crown molten on the floor of gold
Light pierced through the bane
Evil god has fallen down, our hearts are free of cold
The end of our pain

We lived through fires of hell
The war was way of life
We kissed the death itself
The dark times we survived
Salvation in the night came with the light

Free, free, our souls will be forever free
Through the burning chaos in the darkest times
We crushed the chains of fear and we reached the sky
Light will never die, Righteousness and balance have returned
It's freedom's dawn

Devastated blackened land, we'll rebuild it stone by stone
In force of light we trust
Peace and order will ascend, justice will retake the throne
New world rising from the dust

We lived through fires of hell
The war was way of life
We kissed the death itself
The dark times we survived
Salvation in the night came with the light

Free, free, our souls will be forever free
Through the burning chaos in the darkest times
We crushed the chains of fear and we reached the sky
Light will never die, Righteousness and balance have returned
It's freedom's dawn


Kingdom dwelling in light
Darkness forgotten and banished
As the people unite
For eternity evil will perish

Winds of time fly away
Countless souls leave for the sky
But the legend will stay
Our feat will live on till the end of time
